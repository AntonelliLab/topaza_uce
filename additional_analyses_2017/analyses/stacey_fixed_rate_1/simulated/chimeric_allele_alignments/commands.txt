# set up in BEAUTI2.4.4, using STACEY plugin
# 150 most informative UCE loci from simulated data
# assigned both allele sequences to the individual they were sampled from (f1,f1,f2,f2,etc)
# entered substitution models from jModeltest (JC=JC69, K80=HKY85, SYM=GTR)
# strict clock, fixed clock rate of 1.0 for sim_alignment_2, all other loci estimated
# Tree:Species = STACEY default, says 'Yule model' but means BirthDeathCollapse model, choosing collapse height=3E-4 (small collapse heights don't differ much among each other, only when choosing a very large value here, you will end up with only one cluster)
# bdcGrowthRate = log normal, M=4.6, S=1.5
# clock rate for each locus = log normal, M=0.0, S=1.0 (manually have to choose log normal distribution for all loci, but only change M and S for one locus, for all others search and replace in the resulting xml file)
# collapseWeight = Beta distribution, alpha=2, beta=2 (when small value=more inferred clusters, when large value=less inferred clusters)
# popPriorScale = log normal, M=-7, S=2
# relativeDeathRate = Beta distribution, alpha=1.0, beta=1.0 (default)
# MCMC chain length=1,000,000,000, store every=20,000, tracelog=20,000, speciesTreeLogger=20,000, store each gene tree every 10,000,000 (manually set for one, then search and replace in the xml file for all others)
# make sure the Jukes Cantor model is correctly chosen for all loci, the default, which appears to be JC through the interface is something else and will cause an error

sed -i '' '/f2/d' simulated_allele_uces_top_150_all_taxa.xml
# manually remove remaining "</taxon>" in xml file

changed the taxon assignments in the xml file, allowing every sequence to be it's own taxon
replaced the allele alignments witht he chimeric alignments in xml file
